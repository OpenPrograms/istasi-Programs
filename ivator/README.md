See youtube link if you wish to see what this program does.


The config file located at /usr/etc/ivator.cfg is a table dump,

you can set different options in this, color codes being one.
another thing you can change is the width, height and amount of columns it should show

box.column sets how many colmns it should do
box.height flat number tells how high a box should be.
box.width flat number tells how wide a box should be, if a number thats less than 1 is provided, for example 0.8 then it'll divide said number into column width and use that as the width, so it'll 80% of column width.
